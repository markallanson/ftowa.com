              jetty early on a Saturday morning. Old hands Mark A &amp; Dave W 
              turned up as usual, and Leigh made an appearance for his first mini-meet.</font></p></td>

        up a GPX with so many extras for a damn good price... apparently via a 
        forced sale, the lucky beggar. It was the first time I'd seen an FTO with 
        those optional Mitsy kickplates (glow in the dark logo and all). Add to 
        that a sports exhaust, facelift front spoiler, better suspension and it 
        was a tidy little number indeed.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2">First stop was a tea-room style food joint out in Middle 
        Swan. After a bit of tyre-kicking in the carpark, we ordered up a hearty 
        breakfast and planned the final route for the day's driving.</font></p>

          <td width="64%" height="164"> <p><font size="2">Earlier that week, I'd 
              mentioned the upcoming drive at the garage while getting my custom 
              oil temp gauge wired up. It turned out that Barry Lloyd at Crockenberg 
              Motors was a bit of a veteran when it came to interesting Australian 
              country driving (he's actually written a book about his exploits). 
              Barry reckoned that most of the really great drives around Perth 
              had been lost to development over time. However, one route still 
              stood out in his mind - Route 359 (Chittering Rd) between Bullsbrook 
              and Bindoon.</font></p></td>

      <p><font size="2">The 4-car convoy pulled out of the carpark and headed 
        north until reaching RAAF Pearce air base, at which point we turned off 
        onto Chittering Rd.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">This turned out to be an absolutely cracking drive. In 
        many areas, the road followed the course of a creek (with beautiful views 
        across the gully), so there were plenty of twists and turns. We would 
        frequently burst out of a sharpish bend onto a straight section of road 
        with perfect visibility, blue sky above and gum trees whipping by on both 
        sides. It was no wonder the loud pedal got a bit of a workout that morning!</font></p>

              recall there being a single badly cambered bend or a challenging 
              section of road that wasn't clearly identifiable well in advance. 
              Definitely one of the nicer stretches of tarmac around these parts.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">All too soon, we reached the end of that little 
              run, so we pulled over for a breather. Dave commented that it was 
              the first time in 15 minutes that the revs had dropped below MIVEC 
              range...</font></p></td>

        had a prior commitment in Perth, however, so he left us at that point 
        and headed back the way we'd just come. Perhaps he just wanted to drive 
        Route 359 again!</font></p>

              limit.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">It should be noted that a manual FTO can come within 
              a whisker of that in second gear, so changing down to go around 
              a 75km/h caravan means a whole heap of torque. However, we did have 
              to bear in mind that there were two more vehicles behind the leader 
              - they also needed to overtake if the convoy was to stay together. 
              As a result, plenty of road was needed to keep things safe when 
              passing.</font></p></td>

              examples of motoring history. For some unknown reason, however, 
              I seemed to find their collection of 1970s matchbox cars the most 
              interesting exhibit (sad git that I am). There was much pointing
