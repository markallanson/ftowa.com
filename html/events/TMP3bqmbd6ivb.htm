              by step as I drove it. Others were happy to take their best shot 
              through each lap, and then afterwards discuss areas that could be 
              improved. At one point, Kirsten handed the instructor the car keys 
              with the comment, "Don't tell me what I'm doing wrong, show me what 
              I should be doing!". It must have worked, because her course laps

              they won't position themselves well enough though the coming turns. 
              We were all continually encouraged to "lift our vision" and look 
              ahead through the course. Part-way through the braking zone, focus 
              on the turn-in point. Before reaching it, focus on the corner apex.

      <img src="../../images/seperator.gif" width="637" height="2"> <p></p>
      <p><font size="2">The other issue that quickly raised its ugly head was 
        that of excessive corner entry speed. I don't know what it is about FTO 
        owners - maybe it's all that time spent on the road taking corners at 
        breakneck speed. Practically everybody on the track found themselves going 
        in too hot.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">While it was great fun to enter a corner at 40km/h and 
        try to carry that speed around the full 180-degree bend, it meant that 
        the tyres were fully loaded just keeping the vehicle cornering - there 
        was simply no traction left to use in acceleration until the completion 
        of the turn. As a result, the vehicle would still be doing around 40km/h 
        at corner exit. In reality, it was likely that some speed was scrubbed 
        off by fighting the car, so the exit speed was probably even slower than 
        that.</font></p>
      <img alt="Course Schematic 2" src="http://members.iinet.net.au/%7Ehooper/fto/images/mc_course2.gif" width=549 height=190 border=1 hspace=20 vspace=20><BR> 
      <p><font size="2">In the above diagram, the driver is not able to apply 
        any extra throttle until after <font color=#ff6633>Point (A)</font>. Any 
        attempt to squeeze on some throttle before then will result in the tyres 
        exceeding their ability to provide traction. From the driver's seat, the 
        car feels like it's balanced on a knife-edge... Any extra throttle and 
        you will simply go wide - not an option, as all available track is needed 
        just to complete the turn.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The time taken on the following straight is entirely dependent 
        on the corner <I>exit</I> speed... and the time taken on the straights 
        is the most significant component of overall lap time. As a result, anything 
        we could do to increase the exit speed would get us down the straight 
        faster, leading to faster times around the entire course.</font></p>
      <img alt="Course Schematic 3" src="http://members.iinet.net.au/%7Ehooper/fto/images/mc_course3.gif" width=549 height=190 border=1 hspace=20 vspace=20><BR> 
      <p><font size="2">By modifying our braking to enter the corners more slowly, 
        we could turn in more sharply, start to get on the throttle from <font color=#ff6633>Point 
        (B)</font> and <I>straighten out</I> the corner exit line. It was entirely 
        possible to be at full throttle by the time the vehicle exited the corner, 
        and to be travelling at close to 60km/h. This increase in speed would 
        carry through the entire straight.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Of course, it takes time to break old habits, and the 
        excitement of the day meant that most drivers (myself definitely included) 
        barrelled into corner after corner at the very limit. Instead of braking 
        more, turning in late and then getting on the throttle, we ended up fighting 
        the car the whole way through the corner, and coming out slow. Spectacular, 
        but not very fast.</font></p>

              Craig took his turbo MR2 out and gave it some serious stick around 
              the course. A fine looking motor indeed... It was also great to 
              stand just a few feet away from these cars while they were in full 
              flight, and listen to those high-revving Jap powerplants zooming 
              by...</font></p></td>

      <p><font size="2">As well as a carpark full of FTOs and an MR2, Ray T brought 
        his NX coupe out to play. It proved itself to be no slouch in the handling 
        department, with some competitive times posted. On a course layout like 
        this, the biggest advantage does not necessarily go to the vehicle with 
        the most grunt - it's all about smoothness, positioning and handling. 
        There have apparently been some 500bhp vehicles trounced by far smaller 
        cars, simply due to the way they were driven.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2">Part way through the event, the course layout was changed 
        to a faster, more challenging route. The slalom was removed, and some 
        extra turns added...</font></p>

      <p><font size="2">This was a bit quicker, especially with the right positioning 
        when coming out of the 180-degree corners. For example, if the bottom 
        left corner exit leads to a sharper turn to the left, the run through 
        the two "gates" can be taken virtually in a straight line.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In the latter part of the day, the laps were timed so 
        we could compare different approaches. Individual fastest lap times were 
        as follows:</font></p>
