        plains, before ascending into the hills. We had a perfect, clear run on 
        the flats, but as soon as we reached the foothills became stuck behind 
        an ancient truck loaded with concrete blocks, barely able to manage 50km/h.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">One by one, we blasted around him when the straights (and 
        full visibility) permitted.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">We had just about reached town when out of nowhere came 
        Captain Chaos in his 4x4, on a suicide dash to nowhere at Mach 3. As well 
        as scaring oncoming drivers witless, he also managed to fire stones the 
        size of golf balls at the convoy with inhuman accuracy. Practically everybody 
        reported a direct hit on either windscreen, spoiler or wing mirror. Good 
        one, mate.</font></p>

              town until we spotted the Millhouse Cafe. Given Dwellingup's modest 
              size, the search took all of 45 seconds!</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">This restaurant is a great destination for a day 
              on the road. There is as much seating as you could want, a pizza 
              oven and a large balcony overlooking the town's oval. It is apparently 
              a favoured lunch stop for many Perth car clubs. Dwellingup is not 
              too distant from Perth, but enough to make it a good drive.</font></p></td>

        beer in hand, crickets chirping, flies buzzing... another perfect day 
        in Oz!</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The food itself was excellent. Despite a decent array 
        of choices, the vast majority went for the pizza. We all got our liquid 
        intake back up to par (especially those not driving back!), and everyone 
        enjoyed having a good chinwag.</font></p>
