            Just a quick note to thank you all for the great participation at 
            MC Motorsport. </font> 
            <p><font size="2">Personal highlights for me...</font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font size="2">Every single person who confirmed rolled up on 
                the day. To get 12 out of 12 attending without a single no-show 
                really made my day.</font></li>
              <li><font size="2">Everyone stayed safe and drove home at the end 
                of the day. No mechanical problems, tow-ways, etc.</font></li>
              <li><font size="2">John Clark commenting to me that &quot;This is 
                a really good group of people&quot;, He also asked if we were 
                a car club, and was pretty astonished that we were just an informal 
                bunch.</font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font size="2">Seeing everyone really get in there and give it 
              a real go. They'd mentioned beforehand that for groups scared to 
              pull their finger out and push things to their limits, the instructors 
              often get the fire hose out and wet the corners down (to induce 
              understeer and oversteer for timid drivers). As you probably noticed, 
              they weren't looking to get out any fire hoses for us! :)</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">I'll get the pictures up asap, and let you know 
              where they are. I've attached one now to whet your appetite. If 
              anyone has a good shot of my off-road adventure, can you email it 
              to me please. My wife thinks it is very funny, and would like to 
              make fun of me some more. If I'd done the same thing off a road 
              up a kerb, she probably wouldn't be so amused.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Thanks again! I'll be in touch about the next proposed 
              group outing, whatever that may be.</font></p>
