        of progressively stronger proportions.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I decided to select a product that had 
        performed well in several Australian automotive magazine "octane booster

        on the web, as little as 1 millilitre of product per litre of <B>BP Ultimate 
        98</B> fuel would bring the mixture to 100RON standard. I purchased a 
        300ml bottle (the "black" bottle) for around $30. In the advertised proportions, 
        this would be quite cost-effective, with my average 40 litre fill-up costing 
        an extra $4 in additive.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The testing procedure was simple...</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
      <ul>
        <li>Perform a baseline dyno run without any additive. 
        <li>Add 1ml/litre of Nitrous Formula. 
        <li>Perform dyno run. 
        <li>Add an additional 1ml/litre of Nitrous Formula.

        carefully calculated to ensure the mixture achieved was correct with regard 
        to the total fuel load in the tank.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The first application was poured in immediately 
        prior to adding a good quantity of fuel at the bowser. This ensured that 
        the recommended quantity was mixed in the recommended manner.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Subsequently, additive was pre-mixed with 
        petrol in a 5 litre jerrycan before being poured into the tank. A top-up 
        at the bowser mixed things up a little more. For good measure, a twisty 
        drive through suburbia was perfomed on the way to each test run to make 
        sure this brew was both shaken and stirred!</font></p>

        ECU adjusts its timing so as to produce as much power as possible given 
        the fuel it has to work with. It does so by using the <B>Knock Sensor</B> 
        to detect pre-ignition of the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder. Anecdotal 
        evidence suggests that rather than triggering a brief timing retardation 
        in response to detonation, the FTO computer may make a persistent shift 
        to more conservative ignition timing. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This is the reason that long-time FTO 
        owners often suggest performing an "ECU reset" when a switch is made to 
        high octane fuel. This process involves nothing more than removing the 
        negative terminal from the battery, and leaving it disconnected for a 
        duration. When reconnected, the ECU memory will have been cleared, and 
        will have supposedly reverted to its default timing mode - tuned for Japanese 
        100RON fuel.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I had not yet performed an ECU reset on 
        the vehicle being tested, but due to the complete absence of any measured

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Back to baseline again! The previous run 
        showed some improvement, but it had disappeared. How could this be?</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There are only two realistic possibilities 
        as far as I could see...</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><B>#1 - Fuel Temperature</B></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The <I>air</I> temperature during this 
        test was 15 degrees C. This was about 3 degrees warmer than during the 
        previous evening, so the <B>Home Dyno</B> software corrected slightly 
        <I>in favour</I> of the most recent test. However (and it is a big however), 
        the average Perth daily temperature cycle sees the lowest recorded temperatures 
        around 5am or 6am, and the car was parked out in the open all night. It 
        was a cold night, and this would have lowered the temperature of the <B>fuel 
        in the tank</B> a great deal. The morning test run was the first use for 
        the car that day (with an appropriate warm-up drive, of course).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In contrast, the previous day's tests 
        were performed in the evening, with the car previously parked in the sun 
        all day. It had also been driven regularly. Being an EFI system, fuel 
        constantly circulates through a pressurised fuel rail at the top of the 
        engine. Unused petrol (ie. most of it) returns to the tank - a little 
        bit warmer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It is highly likely that the fuel in the 
        tank was significantly <I>cooler</I> for that last test. Can the temperature 
        of the fuel being vapourised really have an effect on performance? The 
        temperature of the outside air being drawn in certainly makes a difference. 
        It is possible that the ambient fuel temperature could play a part in 
        this equation as well...</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><B>#2 - ECU Timing Retardation Still Occurring</B></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If the engine ECU had <I>still</I> detected 
        some pre-ignition, and if it utilised persistent retarded timing modes, 
        then the reversion to baseline would not be hard to understand.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In this scenario, let's assume that some 
        mild pre-ignition occurred at (say) 7,300rpm during that morning test 
        run. It had been preceded by an ECU reset, and the computer would be using 
        timing designed for 100RON fuel. If you look back at the earlier graph, 
        there is even a slight drop in power at this point (which is why I chose 
        7,300rpm for this hypothetical).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If the FTO engine management works by 
        switching to progressively more retarded timing, it would do so at this 
        point. If it also "remembers" its selected timing mode, then that would 
        result in a "back-to-baseline" test result from our third dyno run.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If we were still on the receiving end

        fuel-air mixture more ability to resist detonation.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">An ECU Reset was performed, and enough 
        additional octane booster was added to bring the overall concentration 
        to 4ml/litre. Here was the result:</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">For me, this shot down the pre-ignition 
        theory...</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">First, I was extremely careful <I>not</I> 
        to drive the vehicle very hard between the ECU reset and the dyno run. 
        This torque curve on the graph was definitely the first time that engine 
        ECU had seen over 5,000rpm. There was simply no opportunity for detonation 
        to occur before this test.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Second, every test performed in the evening 
        consistently returned a power curve on par with the original baseline. 
        The single test that returned a higher curve was the one performed mid-morning, 
        after a cold night outside. Coincidence, or environmental? I would suggest 
        the latter. I certainly could not justify crediting the 2ml/litre fuel 
        octane rating with the small torque increase on that run.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Incidentally, I graphed the average of 
        all three tests running on 2ml/litre additive. The result was a near-perfect 
        match with the baseline graph.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The FTO GPX runs just fine on straight 
        98 octane fuel. No measurable improvement in performance was discernible 
        when using a good quality octane booster. While it may give you a good 
        feeling to increase your RON level so it is closer to Japanese 100-octane 
        juice, no benefit was noticable in the conditions prevalent during these 
        tests.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It should be noted that these tests were 
        performed in the cool air of spring. It may be a different matter in summer! 
        In a heat wave, the mercury can hit 40+ degrees here in Perth. In those 
        conditions, using 98RON fuel may indeed see some pre-ignition occur. If 
        the opportunity arises, I will revisit these tests on a hot summer's day.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On the evidence collected so far, though, 
        I won't be spending my hard-earned cash on any octane boosting fuel additive. 
        While they may work wonders in a WRX, the FTO's naturally aspirated engine 
        is perfectly happy to run on good quality unleaded at the pump.</font></p>
