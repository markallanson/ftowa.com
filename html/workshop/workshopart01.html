      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After owning my FTO for about six months, 
        it was becoming clear that the original Japanese dampers were no longer 
        in reasonable condition. The vehicle had lost its "nailed to the road" 
        feel. There was also the typical FTO problem of worn rear droplink bushes, 
        with frequent knocking sounds coming from the rear. Some suspension work 
        was in order!</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I discussed my options with Malcolm Crockenberg, 
        who brought to the project a wealth of experience in setting up performance 
        vehicles. His preference was always function over form, performance over 
        looks - a result of years of professional rally involvement, no doubt! 
        I was not going to end up with a vehicle too low to get up a driveway, 
        or one with such a hard ride that my wife would leave me.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">New front and rear dampers were ordered 
        from <a href="http://www.checkerflag.co.jp">Checkerflag</a> in Japan... 
        5-way rebound-adjustable "Edusa" shock absorbers well-suited to the FTO.</font></p>

        <img src="/images/workshopart01_1.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="1" title="Removing the stock springs for testing.">
      </center>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The stock springs were removed from the 
        vehicle and sent to <a href="http://www.kingsprings.com">King Springworks</a> 
        in Queensland for coil rating tests. With the standard spring rates and 
        installed ride heights, it was possible to determine the front and rear 
        ride height with uprated springs. It was decided to use 30% uprated springs, 
        with the front dropped by just 25mm. This would finally level the car, 
        as the stock front springs rode an inch higher at the front than at the 
        rear.</font></p>
      <center>
        <img src="/images/workshopart01_2.jpg" width="150" height="200" border="1" title="* Some assembly required!">
      </center>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When replacing worn bushes, standard Mitsubishi 
        rubbers were used. We were not keen on introducing unnecessary harshness 
        with such things as urethane bushes (not unless there was hard evidence 
        they were required). There were also real benefits to keeping the stock 
        bushes in some areas... The FTO utilises a passive rear-wheel steering 
        system thanks to some very pliable bush material that allows a few degrees 
        of toe movement when cornering.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A few other extras such as a front strut 
        brace and a camber/caster adjustment kit would help keep the geometry 
        settings optimal.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">What was arguably the most important part 
        of the handling equation was still to be addressed - the tyres! After 
        all, that's what would have to connect all the fancy new kit to the road. 
        A set of Pirelli P7000 rubber finished off the package very nicely.</font></p>
      <center>
        <img src="/images/workshopart01_3.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="1" title="Mal Crockenberg puts the finishing touches on the job.">
      </center>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Crockenberg Motors put everything together, 
        tuned the damper rebound rate to correctly control the springs and made 
        some tweaks to the standard wheel alignment specs. The result?</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Terrific! The car felt far more stable 
        on any road surface. The ride was not at all harsh, turn-in was sharper 
        and the whole car felt beautifully balanced. Also, the ride height had 
        indeed dropped by an inch at the front, bringing it level with the rear.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Pirellis do a great job, as long as 
        the tyre pressure is raised up to around 41psi front, 38psi rear. I see 
        no need to move to larger rims and lower profile tyres at this stage, 
        as the sidewall deflection when cornering is not excessive at those pressures. 
        It should be noted that Pirelli specifically stated to me that these P7000 
        tyres should run at a <I>minimum</I> 35psi at all times. I was rather 
        dubious at the time, but can now say for sure that pressure around the 
        40psi mark is A Good Thing.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Was it worth it? Most definitely! This 
        material was written 15 months after the above work was completed, and 
        I haven't had a single problem with it. Quite the opposite - it's given 
        me a great deal of driving enjoyment, and has made the car a very capable 
        weekend track day runabout.</font></p>
