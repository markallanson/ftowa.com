        This story starts back in March 2001. A man takes a final look around 
        the airport before heading onto the Boeing 747 for the flight to Canada. 
        Qantas Flight QF52 departs at 11:05pm. Earlier that day he had accepted 
        an innocent enough sounding proposal from a gentleman well known to himself. 
        Little did he know that this proposal would lead to 18 months of heart 
        wrenching grief...</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>Well maybe thats a bit dramatic. But there 
        is a time in any FTO owner's life that the well documented and wallet 
        threatening cambelt change must be made in order for your car to remain 
        healthy and reliable for years to come. Before we get started, I apologise 
        to all GR and GS owners. I use references to the MIVEC engine all the 
        time, but you can ignore this fact as the article has nothing at all to 
        do with MIVEC (except at the end), and everything to do with timing.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>The cambelt can also be the bringer of an unknown 
        and little thought about surprise. The lack of power. Having a stretched 
        or misaligned cambelt can be the cause of a hard-to-notice but significant 
        loss in power across the entire rev range of the 6A12 engine. I will explain 
        how the function of the cambelt and how it works in the following section. 
        </font> </p>
      <div align="left"> 
        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="0">

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><font size=2>In short, the cambelt makes sure that all the camshafts 
          (there are 4 in the DOHC V6 6A12 engine, 2 for each section of the V) 
          spin at the same speed, at the same time. No matter what the RPM of 
          the engine, no matter what the speed of the car, each cam is always 
          in the same degree of rotation relative to all other cams in the engine.</font></p>

        <br>
      </div>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>The cambelt runs around the crankshaft sprocket, 
        located at the bottom of the above diagram. As the crankshaft sprocket 
        spins at the same speed as the crankshaft (the current RPM your engine 
        is running at) it is this that dictates the speed of rotation of the camshafts.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>To look at the importance of cambelt tension 
        and installation you have to think about exactly how camshafts work, and 
        what their function is. This is too long of a discussion for this article, 
        however to cut things short, camshafts are lengths of steel that contain 
        a series of lobes - the cams. The lobes effectively determine how long 
        the inlet and exhaust values are open for, letting the fuel/air mixture 
        into the cylinders, and the burnt gas out of the cylinders.</font></p>
      <div align="left"> 
        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="0">
          <tr> 
            <td bgcolor="#200040"> <p><font size=2><b>How can this effect the 
                power of the engine?</b></font></p></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>Easily. To work properly the cambelt has to 
        align all 4 camshafts perfectly. This means that the cambelt has to slot 
        into the teeth of each camshaft and crankshaft sprocket perfectly. If 
        an error was made misaligning one of the camhafts by 1 sprocket tooth, 
        suddenly the rotation of the cams on that shaft will be out by a certain 
        number of degrees in relation to all other cams in the engine.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>Since the cams determine the opening time of 
        the inlet and exhaust valves, misaligning in one direction has the effect 
        of opening the intake valve of one set of cylinders before the intake 
        valve of the second set of cylinders. The Air/fuel mixture in the first 
        set of cylinders is then sitting inside the cylinder for longer before 
        it is ignited by the spark from the spark plug. </font> </p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>On the exhaust side, this would mean the valve 
        is then opened earlier than the other set of cylinders. Due to the precise 
        timing of the engine, the air/fuel mixture almost definitely won't be 
        fully burnt yet. This means that some of the combustion power of the mixture 
        is not being used to drive the piston down, generating less power.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>If you inadvertently misalign the teeth in 
        the opposite direction, the air/fuel mixture is being let into the cylinders 
        late, so less mixture will be in the cylinder before the spark is ignited. 
        On the exhaust side, the mixture is then left in the cylinder longer before 
        being let out by the exhaust valve.</font></p>
      <div align="left">

      <p align="left"><font size=2>Yes, and No.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>If we were running an old engine with no computer, 
        this would lead to heating problems, and ultimately lower the lifespan 
        of the engine.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>Thankfully the 6A12 engine of the FTO is a 
        nice modern marvel and it relies on a computer to determine a large range 
        of operating parameters. In this case, the FTO's computer will retard 
        or advance the timing of the spark (ie. fire the spark plug earlier, or 
        later than optimal) to account for the problems in cambelt timing. Ultimately 
        this measure taken by the computer is to limit the damage that can occur. 
        Whenever something moves into damage control mode, you are effectively 
        producing less power.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>The amazing thing about all this is that because 
        the FTO's computer deals with the timing problems, the car runs like a 
        dream, as if it was a normal car. No misfiring, no audible problems. The 
        car just seems low on power, no bite, a lack of throttle response.</font></p>
      <div align="left"> 
        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="0">
          <tr>

      <p align="left"><font size=2>No Problem. Its time for a story. Not so dramatic 
        this time, I promise.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>In late March 2001 my cambelt was changed. 
        After this cambelt change the car was low on power, it lacked bite, it 
        lacked throttle response. There were no glaring symbols of failure, no 
        engine warning lights, no explosions (did I say no drama?), nothing. </font> 
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>Before the cambelt change was done the car 
        was dyno'ed to obtain a power reading (it was pure co-incidence that the 
        dyno was done only weeks before the cambelt was changed). The following 
        is the power graph, produced by a BOSCH dynometer. This dyno run was done 
        in early March, 2001, with a K&amp;N POD filter attached to the car. Note 
        that the small spike @ 60km/h is a gear change from 2nd to 4th gear.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><img src="/images/workshopart08_DynoBeforeCambeltChange.jpg" name="Graphic4" align=BOTTOM width=640 height=372 border=0></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>This dyno produced a result of 118kw (157.3hp) 
        at the wheels of the car (The bottom line on the graph above). The curve 
        of this graph is also much as expected, quite linear with a small pull 
        when MIVEC takes over. For the purposes of this article we will ignore 
        fanciful prediction of at-engine horsepower as it is far too inaccurate 
        a calculation. With this in mind ignore the top line above.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>2 weeks after this dyno was done, the cambelt 
        was changed, and replaced incorrectly. Each cam gear (as we were to find 
        18 months later) was replaced one tooth out. Jump forward 18 months. I 
        had been driving the car low on power for that long, not realising what 
        was wrong with the car (or really noticing the lack of power as the car 
        was running as smoothly as the next). </font> </p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>A sudden urge led both myself and Richard to 
        the doors of Myaree Dyno Tune, in Myaree, Western Australia. they use 
        a Dyno Dynamics Dynomometer for their power runs. Richards FTO was driven 
        onto the rollers and spat out a nice 161.4hp at the wheels. My car was 
        then placed on the dyno, and to everyones dissapointment and surprise, 
        ran only 144.8hp. The following is the dyno from this run. Notice the 
        totally erratic power curve, pitfalls and rises in the curve constantly 
        over the power band.</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="/images/workshoppart08_MyareeDyno.gif" name="Graphic5" align=BOTTOM width=640 height=513 border=0></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>There had to be an explanation somewhere, and 
        both RichardH and I set about formulating a plan to track it down. The 
        only logical conclusion we could make was that there was a fuel supply 
        problem somewhere that was causing the computer to alter timing to cope. 
        Blocked injectors were all but ruled out as these would cause a bad idle 
        and audible misfire as sporadic fuel supply generally does. We decided 
        that the culprit could be an old and blocked fuel filter flowing at a 
        constant but less than optimal level.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>Before any action was taken on these items, 
        a chance conversation between RichardH and Mal Crockenberg (<a href="http://www.crockenbergmotors.com.au/">Crockenberg 
        Motors</a>, WA RALLIART supplier and mechanic) led to Mal exclaiming that 
        he had 2 similar cases to this appear in recent times. The first was a 
        Mitsubishi Magna, which ran perfectly but was lacking bite. The second 
        was an EVO Lancer with a similar problem. Both these cars exhibited the 
        same symptoms as my FTO. The solution in both their cases was a cambelt 
        change went wrong, a couple of teeth out here and there.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>With adrenaline running high on this news, 
        I promptly booked the FTO into Crockenberg Motors for a &quot;power hunt&quot; 
        and valve clearance adjustment. A few weekends before the car went into 
        Crockenberg Motors we did some dyno runs using the home dyno software 
        described in <a href="/html/workshop/workshopart04.html"><i><font size=2>Measuring 
        Engine Torque and Power</font></i></a>. Power graphs from these runs were 
        produced and saved, with the intention of comparing these to the post-fix 
        power graphs. The below graph shows the power curve with a K&amp;N Panel 
        filter. Its important to note that the car most likely wasn't generating 
        149hp on this run, these home dyno runs were taken to produce a graph 
        for comparison with later. (Ignore the automatic cutoff message - it does 
        not effect these graphs).</font></p>

        Motors and it was found that each cam gear was 1 tooth out. The power 
        was back and the car ran beatifully (thank you valve adjustments). Before 
        we could be sure though, there was one final step to take. Bring on the 
        dyno graphs. An entire morning and afternoon was spent doing runs with 
        varying intake configurations (refer to next article Comparing POD and 
        Panel Filters). The following graphs show comparisons between the before 
        graph (as shown above) and the after graph.</font></p>

        <b>The above graph shows the comparison of before (blue) and after (red) 
        power.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>Although the car may not produce exactly 167hp 
        and 134 lb/ft, its obvious that there has been a substantial power and 
        torque gain from fixing the cambelt timing issue. What else should we 
        look for in these figures. Well first of all I guess is how smooth the 
        curves are compared to their before counterparts. Changeover to MIVEC 
        is a smoother affair and power delivery is very much a linear experience 
        right up to the redline.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>Another important thing to be revealed from 
        these graphs is the peak torque outputs from the before and after graphs. 
        With the cambelt realignment the maximum torque is produced by the engine 
        a staggering 1000rpm lower. This is a significant change to the output 
        of the engine as the extra torque is most useful as low in the rev range 
        as possible.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size=2>The final thing to notice is that the MIVEC 
        system really is a life saver in this situation. Notice how large the 
        flat spot in power there is right before MIVEC kick-over point in the 
        before graphs (this is extremely evident in the Myaree dyno graph), if 
        we didn't have any MIVEC I doubt that the car would have produced much 
        more than 120hp at its peak, with a steady decline from there all the 
        way to 8000rpm. This may be what a GR owner might experience in this circumstance 
        (anyone with a GR willing to put their cambelt on wrong for us to do a 
        few dyno runs? I didn't think so).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">I will be getting another Myaree Dyno graph 
        soon, I will append that to this article, so check back.</font></p>
