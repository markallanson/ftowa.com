      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever wondered whether an after 
        market sports exhaust system <I>really</I> gives you a faster car? Or 
        is it just the extra decibels giving the <I>impression</I> your car has 
        turned into a speed machine? How about that pod filter recently slapped 
        on in place of the factory induction? Did it provide torque gains across 
        the entire rev range or not?</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">How about an even simpler question... 
        Does a bottle of octane booster in your fuel tank <I>really</I> give you 
        more power, or just leave a big hole in your pocket when all is said and 
        done?</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If you head off to a dyno every time you 
        want an answer, not only does the cost add up, but you'll find the results 
        tend to differ each time - even if nothing has changed on the car! Ambient 
        temperature, relative humidity, the state of the dyno equipment being 
        used, even the temperature of the fuel in the tank... It all makes for 
        a tricky (and increasingly expensive) situation.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I decided to find an alternative.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I purchased a software package known as 
        <a href="http://www.charm.net/~mchaney/homedyno/homedyno.htm" target="_blank"><B>Home 
        Dyno</B></a>. It was capable of taking as input a recording of the engine 
        activity in foot-to-the-floor acceleration through the rev range. When 
        provided with other details about the vehicle in question, it produced 
        a torque and power curve graph, along with raw numeric output.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">But would it really work? And what was 
        the best way to "record" the engine activity?</font></p>

        <tr> 
          <td width="50%"> <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My first attempt 
              was to follow the advice from the Home Dyno instructions and install 
              an inductive sensor on one of the coil leads. This would result 
              in a "spike" every time the coil fired. The FTO MIVEC engine has 
              three coil packs, and uses a "wasted spark" system in which each 
              coil pack services two spark plugs. The software was able to be 
              configured to expect this.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, the electrical interference 
              was far to noisy to result in a clean series of voltage spikes. 
              Many locations were tried, but none were clean enough. Attempts 
              to tidy up the results in a sound file editor were also unfruitful.</font></p>

        Manual, and the sensors to the Engine ECU were reviewed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><B>DISCLAIMER TIME</B>: <I>If you feel 
        the need to play with your own ECU wiring, make sure you read and understand

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The crank angle sensor was just the thing! 
        It would produce multiple spikes per engine revolution, and could be recorded 
        directly, instead of using an inductive sensor. This would result in low 
        noise levels and a clearly defined spike pattern in the sample.</font></p>

              3.5mm mono socket.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To ensure the output voltage was 
              appropriate, I added a 10K resistor to both the positive and negative 
              wires of the lead connecting to the socket. Without this added resistance, 
              problems with engine tickover occur... If the ECU can't get its 
              crank angle input, it will just refuse to run the engine!</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 3.5mm socket was stowed neatly

        to purchase one any time soon. If I did have one, it would very likely 
        be a simple matter to connect a 3.5mm lead from the crank angle sensor 
        directly to a microphone input on the laptop. As it was, I needed something 
        to record while out on the road, in order that I might bring it back home 
        and replay the output into my home machine's microphone input.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The <B>Home Dyno</B> software had an alternative 
        package that included a digital sound recording unit. This sounded like 
        a good idea, so I hunted through the odd electronics catalog here in Perth.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The unit uses an NVRAM chip to record 
              up to 30 seconds of low quality sound. By changing a resistor value, 
              the sampling rate can be increased to record for less time, but 
              with better quality. I experimented a bit, and settled on a 12-second

        in second, I started up the digital recorder and gave the GPX full throttle. 
        The car accelerated right through the rpm range, up to the point where

        <I>too</I> good for the Home Dyno software! For every engine revolution, 
        the crank angle sensor was triggered three times. At the higher rev ranges, 
        the software was simply unable to get enough distinction between each 
        spike. The result was an early termination when processing the file.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Seeing as my day job involves a good deal 
        of coding, it was not diffucult to write a WAV file parser that took the

        result. The WAV modifying tool discards five out of six spikes, leaving 
        just one spike per 4-stroke cycle. I also gave it the ability to massage 
        the wave shape. Instead of a positive and negative voltage wave with a 
        complex shape, it leaves only a single, instantaneous spike.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I did not worry about absolute values 
        at the time (eg. peak torque & power). It was the <I>shape</I> of the 
        torque curve I was interested in. The output was definitely a recognisable 
        "MIVEC" shape, complete with the double peak and the dip at around 5,500rpm. 
        This was enough to convince me that the project was on the right track.</font></p>

      <BR> <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The next phase was to calibrate the

        simply by adding or subtracting an amount from the <B>Test Weight</B> 
        field. Entering a higher-than-actual value did the trick - 1650kg, to 
        be exact.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A similar trick was possible when changing 
        the angle of inclination. In this case, tweaking the <B>Frictional Losses</B> 
        fields moved the top end up and down as required. For anyone interested 
        in using this software with similar settings, I settled on <B>Drag Coefficient</B> 
        of 0.10 and <B>Frontal Area</B> 10.00 Ft^2.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Because I was after "at-wheels" results, 
        the <B>Drivetrain Loss</B> was set to 0.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The result was a good match to the real 
        world graph...</font></p>

      <BR> <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So there you have it! The above graph 
        was taken from a run up a quiet back road, using home-made hardware and 
        some clever software.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This has a lot of potential. A "before" 
        run can be undertaken, followed by any performance modification you care 
        to name. An "after" test can then be done and the results directly compared.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As it has been calibrated with a real 
        world dyno run, I feel the results are accurate, meaningful and a valuable 
        tool for assessing anything performance related.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now every time I see "power" bolt-ons 
        advertised with promises of "higher torque across the entire rev range 
        - guaranteed!", I know it's possible to verify those claims without spending 
        a fortune at the dyno shop...</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I can feel a test of some Octane 
        Booster fuel additives coming on...</font></p>
