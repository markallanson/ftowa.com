Simple pod filters on the main pipe, flexible ducting with filters in front of the radiator, filters where spotlights used to be, steel intake chambers, you name it, it's out there on an FTO somewhere.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In more than three and a half years of FTO ownership, I'd not made a single change to that little MIVEC engine, save for a token K&N panel filter in the stock airbox (which had more to do with the cost and availability of the throw-away standard element than any pretentions towards "performance").  </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Before we go any further, let's take a little ride through the GPX factory induction system.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Let's say a little oxygen molecule foolishly tries to cross the road in front of a MIVEC FTO at full throttle.  Our molecule somehow finds itself sucked into the cavity inside that curvaceous front spoiler, and vanishes down a triangular opening that is furiously gulping down air.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Note that the factory intake point is placed in the "dead" spoiler cavity - as opposed to directly in the airflow - so as to draw in as little dust and rain as possible.  Minimising induction noise may also be a factor.  In factory FTOs, the intake is separated from the radiator by a plastic panel, ensuring the air isn't unduly heated prior to ingestion.  Some FTOs seem to be missing this panel (past accident damage, perhaps?), leaving the duct overexposed to hot air when the car is standing still.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, back to our molecule... which is in for the ride of its life.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Having entered the duct, it makes an immediate 45-degree turn, evades a depression in the duct wall (thanks to an intruding spoiler mounting bracket), makes a series of 45-degree and 90-degree turns, then passes a resonant chamber tee-d into the duct (required to reduce induction noise, at a guess).  It then makes a final 90-degree turn, skirts another depression in the duct (this time because of the protruding headlamp assembly) before ending up in the airbox.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At this point, it's about half-way through its trip into the engine.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On passing through the air filter panel, it makes a 70-degree turn, races through a section of flexible duct (to cater for engine movement/vibration), traverses a flattened section of pipe before a final 90-degree handbrake turn into the throttle body.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As far as thrill rides go, that one is up there with the best of 'em.  But when you've got only 2 litres engine displacement, no turbocharger and a long, inviting road begging to be taken at speed, there's surely some room for improvement!  If we could just straighten out that airflow somewhat, the FTO powerplant might just reward us with a few extra Newton Metres of torque...</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The standard battery size and position is the reason for the intake's abrupt 90-degree turn just before the throttle body.  The duct then requires another bend further down, which ultimately affects the location of the factory airbox.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Some aftermarket FTO induction systems involve (or require) the total relocation of the battery - usually into the boot.  I didn't want to go this far.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">However, it <I>was</I> possible to source a significantly smaller <B>Odyssey</B> brand battery.  The <B>ES 12V 800</B> model was only 110mm high, and still packed quite a punch... more than enough for the FTO.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This particular model was available for under $300 from the usual battery outlets.  At the time of writing, it was the smallest Odyssey that was warranty-covered for installation in a motor vehicle.  Even smaller units were available, but were aimed more at motorcycles, jetskis, etc.  Due to its low profile and overall size, it was a bit fiddly to intall on the tray as a DIY job, but perseverance paid off.  It was gratifying to have the final result pass motorkhana scrutineering (ie. yank at battery to see if it would fall off).</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">With this low-profile battery fitted, it freed up the entire engine bay area from throttle body to strut tower.  Consequently, it was open season on the factory induction system!</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The very next day, I revisited my original design for the upper pipe.  I had initially wanted to utilise all of the factory system's large airbox exit hole, and just step down to the 70mm pipe to the throttle body.  However, at the time, I was unable to fashion a suitable connection.  I ended up settling for a 70mm pipe all the way from the airbox.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I had hoped that the straight piping and bellmouth intake would do the trick.  However, faced with such a depressingly inconsequential result from the dyno test, it wouldn't hurt to try something different!</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It was time to work out how to use the large airbox exit hole in all its 95mm glory.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Out came the grab-bag of Mazda truck goodies, and much creative thought was employed to try and find a good solution.  Whatever connection was used, it had to be flexible, tough and able to connect cleanly using the existing airbox position.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I found a flexible rubber boot in my scavenged accessory bag that fitted the bill.  It was overlooked in the Version 1 construction plan because I had been unable to stretch either end over the wide airbox exit lip.  This time, however, I was not about to be beaten so easily.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">With the aid of some useful tools (and my wife) the boot was fitted tightly in place.  I then shortened the pipe to the throttle body, fashioned a new bellmouth shape at the start (for better airflow, and also to fit inside the flex shape part of the rubber boot) and voila!  Version 2 was ready.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well, almost ready.  After the results of the previous dyno run, I was not about to spend much time and effort with the industrial adhesive - especially as there was a high probability of a "Version 3" attempt in the not-too-distant future!  So I resorted to a bit of shameful duct taping as a short term test facilitator.  The pipe fit was already snug, but I wanted to ensure it was totally airtight and stable.  As long as the engine bay temperatures did not get too high, this would be more than adequate for one more dyno run.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As before, I ran back-to-back Home Dyno tests using both the complete factory induction and the Version 2 custom design.  I was getting very good at installing and removing these things!</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I had also given into temptation and cleaned the K&N panel filter.  It was filthy.  As I was not trying to compare the previous day's runs with a new run, this was not going to compromise any performance comparisons.  Both the latest runs were performed using the clean filter, and within two and a half hours of each other.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The new intake setup gives the MIVEC powerplant additional torque from 4500rpm right up to 8000rpm.  That large chamber of air between the panel filter and final pipe to throttle body made all the difference in the world.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a result.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">No discussion about MIVEC induction modifications would be complete without mentioning the aural feedback issue.  At wide open throttle, this induction system does indeed sound more throaty.  However, it isn't one of those 150dB screamers like some I could name!  It is also indistinguishable from a stock system at part throttle/below 4500rpm.  Of course, if you <I>like</I> sounding like a fighter plane on afterburners, you won't like this intake setup at all...</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">
        <ol>
        <li>It works!  Proven gains across a substantial part of the rpm range (from 4500rpm through to redline).
        <li>No loss of torque below 4500rpm, so no impact on bottom end drivability.
        <li>Throttle response does not seem to have been negatively impacted.
        <li>It looks like a factory system (well, once the duct tape is no longer needed!).
        <li>This system utilises the standard filter element and airbox.
        <li>It draws cool, clean air.  Filter will last longer (or need cleaning less frequently).
        <li>You won't wake up sleeping babies and old folks five kilometres away.

Back-to-back tests were performed within a few hours, with the same type and amount of fuel in the tank.  Ambient temperatures were noted and corrected for by the Home Dyno software.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I have refrained from putting actual figures on any torque/power graphs, as I haven't recently done a calibration of the Home Dyno setup compared to a real world dyno.  At this stage, back-to-back comparisons are the order of the day, as opposed to peak power numbers.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The next step may be to get the upper and lower pipes professionally made, as opposed to the "prototypes" used for these tests.

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">One of the graphs showed air/fuel ratio.  The usual 'dip' (ie. rich mixture) was evident immediately after MIVEC cutover... between 5700 and 6300rpm.  With a properly tuned fuel computer, the staff were of the opinion that this torque curve would be freed from that midrange 'hole'.  This was apparently common on many Honda VTEC powerplants as well.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It's also worth noting that this dip does not seem to be as severe in my 2nd gear "on-road" Home Dyno runs.  Interesting...</font></p>

As I'm able to do back-to-back runs using my own test equipment, the real world dynos are simply there to provide hard, calibrated figures for reference.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Part of the test process was to drop a sensor into the open mouth of the intake pipe behind the spoiler, and 'tee' a second one into the throttle body vacuum hose.  The dyno controller could then provide a graph of pressure drop across the entire rpm range.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The staff at Hyperdrive Motorsport commented that the pressure drop across this system was extremely low.  They ran off a graph to show this alongside a power curve (see left), and it was never more than 0.16 PSI.  Indeed, up to 6000rpm, the pressure drop was barely above 0.8 PSI.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Using a different scale, this works out to be a restriction of between 2.5 and 5 inches of water at the throttle body...  clear evidence of efficient air filtering and delivery.</font></p>
